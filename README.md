# Accessing Class Members Before Constructor Completion in C#

This example demonstrates a potential issue in C# where accessing class members before the constructor has fully initialized them can lead to unexpected results.  This can occur when members are accessed within methods or properties before the `this` keyword has been properly initialized.

## The Bug

The `DoSomething` method attempts to access and print the `Value` property before the constructor has finished setting its initial value.  Depending on how the class and members are used, accessing a member before its proper initialization may result in undefined or unexpected values, or it may even throw an exception.

## The Solution

The most straightforward solution is to ensure that all member accesses within a method or property happen only after the constructor has completely finished executing.  Methods that require member data should not be called before the constructor's initialization is finished.
